## Software
* I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding in JavaScript, Python and Terraform. Lately I've been working with Kotlin and for that I rely on [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/), really promising editor.
* The new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is my terminal of preferrence, it has become really good and give me the best of both worlds (Windows + Linux) with WSL.
* When it comes to managing my to-dos and project notes, I rely on [Notion](https://www.notion.so) to keep everything organized.
* I use [Brave](https://brave.com/) as my main browser, it keeps ADs and Spam away with zero config.
* [DBeaver](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver) is the tool I use for working with relational databases.
* And last but not least I use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing from REST, to GraphQL and gRPC.
